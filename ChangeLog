	* configure.in: version is now 1.3.6;

	* tktray.c: fixed some trivial bugs with option
	handling (e.g. cget method); added ARGB32 image output
	support (server-side natural alpha composition).
	* tests/all.tcl: added a non-photo image to test this code path

	* configure.in: version is now 1.3.2.
	added --with-mad-tk-packager (see README)

	* tktray.c:
	balloon/cancel methods are now supported;

	building without private headers is possible now;

	complex alpha in images looks good.

	Shape extension was thrown away.

	C89 is the target now (no GNU or C99 features needed).

	-W -Wall -ansi -pedantic is now the warning option set for
	GCC (with some really annoying and senseless warnings suppressed)

	* docs/tktray.man:
	documented new features, fixed description of some old ones.

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, tclconfig/*: TEA update
	* configure: regen
	* doc/tktray.man: documented new features
	* tktray.c: implemented old-style pseudo-transparency; split
	widget into a persistent front-end & temporal helper window;
	borrowed bbox algorithm from xwininfo, seems to work everywhere;
	threw away a lot of image/photo handling code, using a simple,
	standard Tk_GetImage in all places except where XShapeCombineMask
	is used (current version works well without XShapeCombineMask).

2009-08-21  Anton Kovalenko  <anton@sw4me.com>

	* tktray.c: applied patch from Sergey Golovan (thanks):
	image lookup by name is now dynamic (where it's needed).

	* pkgIndex.tcl.in: applied patch from Sergey Golovan:
	don't register package when runtime Tcl version is lower
	than build-time version.

	* tclconfig: replaced with the latest TEA files.

	* Makefile.in: minor modifications for newer autoconf
	* configure: regenerated

2005-01-06  Anton Kovalenko <anton@sw4me.com>
	* tktray.c (TrayIconObjectCmd): added "bbox" command,
	because [winfo root*] happens to be unreliable in case of
	embedded windows.

2005-12-12  Anton Kovalenko <anton@sw4me.com>
	Initial release.
	Tested with trayer 1.0, gnome-panel 2.10.2.
